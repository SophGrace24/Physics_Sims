# Physics_Sims
Various Physics Sims I've implemented for funsies.

# How to play
You can download the file and run it in your terminal. If you use VScode, just open the file there and run it via python. 

I used these files to test EMBR's ability to manipulate environments when the physics are substrate neutral. For all transparency sake, Google's Gemini helped with the final polish of the code just to ensure everything ran the way they should. 

I figured it didn't hurt to upload these because they're fun. Some of them are interactive so spacebar, arrow keys or mouse click (like the fractals sim) can change how the game plays. Enjoy.
